# Cheatsheet

There are some basic HTML, CSS, JS or Ruby concepts that I am always looking at on google because I can't remember it or because it is easier to copy/paste it. So to save time I decided to do this personal cheatsheet with some boilerplate codes and simple explanations.


Built with React using a simplified version of [this original template](https://github.com/HashemKhalifa/webpack-react-boilerplate)
(Even if React is not the best choice for a project with a lot of HTML content like that, it was the easiest solution in order to split my sections into different files without the need of a server side backend in order to use Github Pages.)
